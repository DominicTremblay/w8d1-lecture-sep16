## Why Testing

### Barriers to Testing

- Takes too much time
- Cost more

  - You have to deliver the app/feature yesterday
  - It feels like a waste of time
  - There is no budget left for testing
  - don't like testing

### Benefits of Testing

- Confidence about your code
- Reduce bugs
- Improve the overall code quality
- Make it production-ready

### Types of Tests

- Static

  - Linter
  - Static Type System (PropTypes, Flow, TypeScript)

- Unit Testing

  - Test that individual units (functions usually, maybe a module) work as expected
  - Does the function given the same input gives the same output every time
  - Pure functions are easier to test

- Integration Tests

  - Test that several units are working together as expected
  - Mocking: faking API calls

- End-to-End Testing

  - Test the whole app, much like a user would use the app
  - Takes longer to test

- BDD (Behavior Driven Development)

## Test-Driven Development

- Create the test first
- Write the code to make the test pass

1. Write a failing test
2. Write the minimum amount of code to make the test pass

- we don't care that much about writing clean code
- we just write code that makes the test pass

3. Refactor

- Refactor and improve
- All tests should still pass

## Code Coverage

- Percentage of the code that has gone through our tests

  - functions
  - if else
  - lines of code

- The goal is not necessarily to have 100% code coverage, but to decide what to test

## Writing Tests

## Demo

- We'll be writing tests with [JEST](https://jestjs.io/)

  - [JEST Matchers](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect)

- Decide what to test
- Isolate the tested code using mocks
- Test helpers [React-Testing-Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
